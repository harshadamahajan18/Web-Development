<!-- Inline Elements

Definition: Inline elements do not start on a new line. They occupy only the width required by their content.

Examples: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>

<p>This is an <span>inline</span> element.</p>
<a href="#">This is a link</a>

Block Elements

Definition: Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <li>, <section>

<div>This is a block element.</div>
<p>This is a paragraph, which is also a block element.</p>

Key Differences:

1. Layout: Inline elements flow with the text, while block elements start on a new line.

2. Width: Inline elements take up only as much width as necessary, while block elements take up the full width of their container.

3. Containment: Block elements can contain other block elements or inline elements, while inline elements generally only contain text or other inline elements. -->
